## Hi, I'm Shruti! 👋
 a CS + Business Econ student at UCSD with a design minor — basically someone who loves building cool stuff that mixes tech and creativity.
Right now, I’m all about AI, 3D, and making interfaces that actually feel easy and fun to use. Whether it’s automating 3D scenes with AI or crafting virtual assistants, I’m always tinkering and learning.
I also enjoy:
Writing clean code in Python, JavaScript, and C++
Designing simple, thoughtful user experiences
Collaborating on open-source projects and sharing what I learn along the way
When I’m not glued to a screen, you might catch me snapping photos, exploring new places, or geeking out over the latest tech trends.
Feel free to check out my repos and hit me up if you want to chat or collaborate!
